Hi [Student's Name],  

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your situation. We’re sorry to hear about your family emergency, and we hope everything is improving.  

Since this is your first absence, we can approve this as an excused absence. No proof is required, and this will not count toward your allowed absences.  

If you need any assistance catching up on missed coursework, feel free to explore our course materials on [Course Portal](https://www.codepath.org/courses) or let us know if you have any concerns. 

Take care, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything.
