### **Scenario C: Student Submitted Their Assignment Late**  

```md
Hi [Student's Name],  

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your situation. We understand that balancing school, work, and personal responsibilities can be challenging.

Since you have already used up your two allowed 48-hour deadline extensions, any further extension will be treated as a withdrawal appeal. However, as per our policy, we automatically approve additional 48-hour extensions if a student requests more time.

I have reopened the submission for Project 6, and you now have an additional 48 hours to submit your work. Please make sure to complete and submit your assignment within this time frame.

Let me know if you need further assistance. Wishing you the best with your coursework!

Regards,  
Tine
