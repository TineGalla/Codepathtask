### **Scenario D: Request for a Deadline Extension**  

```md

Hi [Student's Name],  

Thank you for reaching out and keeping us informed about your situation. We understand that unexpected technical issues can arise and impact coursework.  

Per our deadline extension policy, we can approve your request for a one-week extension. This means your new deadline is **October 12th at 11:59 PM (your time zone)**.  

If you continue facing technical difficulties, we recommend using university computer labs or public library facilities as temporary alternatives. Let us know if you need further assistance.  

Wishing you the best, and we hope youâ€™re able to resolve your laptop issue soon!  

Regards,  
Tine
