### **Scenario E: Student is Unable to Join the Zoom Session**  

```md
Hi [Student's Name],  

Thank you for reaching out. We understand how frustrating it can be to experience access issues, especially during the first session.  

Here are a few troubleshooting steps to help resolve this issue:  

1. **Verify your GitHub account** – Ensure you are logged into the correct GitHub account linked to your course profile.  
2. **Check the session link** – Confirm that you are using the correct attendance URL from your course portal.  
3. **Clear cache and cookies** – Sometimes, browser caching issues prevent access.  
4. **Try using an incognito/private browser window** to see if the issue persists.  
5. **If your GitHub account is missing from the system**, follow the [GitHub recovery steps](https://hackmd.io/@djbungay/githubrecover).  

If you have followed these steps and are still unable to access the session, please let us know for us to furhter assist.

Regards,  
Tine

Note: Informing the direct zoomlink as last resort will not encourage student to do BTS.
